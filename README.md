# todo-list

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Marketionist/todo-list.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Marketionist/todo-list)

A minimalistic app for storing todo lists in any browser (mobile browsers are
supported too!). It does not require any Internet connection - utilizes
localStorage, so the list will be available as long as the browser is opened.

## Installation and usage
To use this app execute 2 simple steps:
1. Download [the archive of this app](https://github.com/Marketionist/todo-list/archive/master.zip)
    and extract the archive **OR** open
    [raw todo-list.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marketionist/todo-list/master/todo-list.html)
    and *right click* -> *Save As* -> *Save*
2. Open `todo-list.html` in your browser and enjoy adding notes or grocery lists!
